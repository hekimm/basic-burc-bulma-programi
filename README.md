# Zodiac Sign Determination Project

## Overview

This project is a simple Java program that determines the user's zodiac sign based on their birth month and day. The user inputs their birth month and day, and the program calculates the zodiac sign using conditional statements. This project serves as an excellent introduction to using conditionals, handling user input, and basic Java programming.

## Features

- Takes birth month and day as input from the user.
- Displays the user's zodiac sign.
- Checks for valid input to ensure that the day and month values are correct.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- A Java code editor or IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse, NetBeans, or VS Code).

### Running the Project

1. **Clone the Repository (Optional):** If the code is in a repository, clone it using:

2. **Open the Code Editor/IDE:** Open your favorite Java IDE or code editor and create a new project named `ZodiacSign`.



3. **Compile and Run:** Compile and run the program.

4. **User Input:** The program will prompt you to enter your birth month and day. Enter the information to see your zodiac sign.

## Example

## Explanation

The program uses `if-else` statements to determine the zodiac sign based on the user's birth month and day. The input is validated to ensure that both the month and day values are within appropriate ranges. If the input is invalid, the program displays an error message and terminates.
